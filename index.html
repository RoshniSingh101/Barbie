        <!-- home page description of the website's purpose, to spread awareness about the Barbie movie's impact on society and its importance -->
        <p class = "pink">The Barbie movie is an outstanding piece of cinematography that has hit the screens at the right time and place. It's an impressive satirical work that tweens and older need to watch. Without relaying any spoilers of the movie, the premise is that the Barbies and the Kens are enjoying their utopia in Barbie Land until one day, Barbie (Margot Robbie) begins questioning the perfection Mattel created for young girls worldwide. Barbie becomes imperfect and needs to go to the real world to find the solution to changing her back to her perfect self. Unlike light-hearted humor viewers may think this movie possesses, Greta Gerwig uses satire to make people think of what the real world can look like when people push unpopular opinions to rule society. However, there is so much more to Barbie than the movie covers.
